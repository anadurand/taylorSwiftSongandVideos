Crowdbotics Frontend Engineering Challenge

#### Trial Project
This project will give you a chance to see how we work at Crowdbotics.  You should spend no more than 10 hours, but you may not need all of that time to carry out the work.  If you do not finish within 10 hours, simply stop at 10 hours.  You should finish this work within 3 days.  

#### Frontend Implementation
Imagine that you are working with a designer to build an interactive web application for a client. 

The client is a big fan of the musician Taylor Swift.  The client would like to build an application to scroll through songs from Taylor Swift. He suggested you can use the iTunes API to get a list of songs.  

The iTunes database is accessible via API without authentication or signup. You can read about the API here. It contains all instructions on how to access the data you will need for this project. (The client tells you to use “Search Examples” section to save time; you do not need to read the full API.)

- The designer has presented you with the following mockup.


- The client has given you the following instructions:

    - the list should display up to 200 Taylor Swift songs read from the API. 
    - The list should include the trackName, collectionName, and trackId from the API.
    - the list should contain no duplicate songs. If two or more songs have exactly the same title, only one should be   shown.
    - the list should be scrollable.
    - the list should display an image from the API associated with the song.
    - the page should load fast.



- The designer asks you to implement four features:
    - each song in the list should change color to gray on mouseover
    - the list of songs section should scroll vertically to allow the user to see the entire list.
    - the title bar at top should stay in place and be visible on the screen even when the list scrolls.
    - the section at right (“other charts”) should not scroll. This content should be displayed as written.


#### Instructions
    1) If you have any questions or are missing any information, please ask in Slack.

    2) Write down a plan to implement this design and the requested features. Include all necessary steps that you think will be required. Include a time estimate for each step.  Include a list of questions to ask before beginning work.

    3) Carry out the plan and check your code in to Github. You can use any images you want from the web for the graphical assets (logos, icons, and pictures). These assets do not need to match the ones in the mockup.

    4) Answer the question: is there anything else that is needed before this can be deployed to production?
